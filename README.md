Infamous, colossal waste of time.  Yet, here we are.

## Synthesis

### Intro
First, I am not a mathematician.  I struggled with Differential Equations and linear algebra.  Nor am I a tried and true programmer.  

However, I am curious by nature.

I do not have any hope of finding a solution to the Collatz Conjecture or to win a Nobel Prize, but if my data/findings are helpful for you, please do cite my work.  Also, a hardcopy would be nice :)

### Description

In my own, unpolished words, the Collatz conjecture proposes that all non-zero, positive integers as subjected to the following algorithm will always find their way back to a 4-2-1 loop, meaning the loop will never end.

```
Algorithm:

1. Take integer (positive, non-zero) as starting point n
  1. If n is odd, perform the calculation 3*n+1 and set the result as n
  2. If n is even, perform the calculation n/2 and set the result as n
2. Repeat

```

The issue with the conjecture is that so far, noone has been able to prove or disprove if it holds true for all n to infinity.  Brute force measurements have checked all digits of n to 2^68 and it holds true.
